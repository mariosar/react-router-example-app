# React Router SPA Example

This is a basic repo using `create-react-app` that includes the `react-router-dom` library and uses some of its functionality to teach how to use it to make SPA apps. The accompanying tutorial can be found [here](https://mariosaraiva.com/react/2019/11/01/react-spa-with-react-router-dom.html)

The remainder of the documentation is the standard Create React App readme.
